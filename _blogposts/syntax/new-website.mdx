**Edit (24th April 2020):** This post refers to the website
[reasonml.github.io](//reasonml.github.io).

Notice anything different? =)

The new documentation website is built by our community member [Jared](https://jaredforsyth.com) (make sure to check his Reason blog posts too!). The new site keeps most of the same content from the old one, while providing a better structure to navigate through them. You'll notice "Suggest an edit" links all over the place. Take a look around!

(Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org))
