## New Improvements

Based on popular feedback, we've now improved our online [Try](//reasonml.github.io/try) section. Highlights:

- Bidirectional conversion. Write Reason, get OCaml translation, vice-versa.
- Live evaluation, with console feedback in the lower-right section.
- Most of the [standard library](//reasonml.github.io/api/index.html) is now loaded. Since we're evaluating on the web, This includes BuckleScript's [extra stdlib APIs](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/).
- Sharable code snippet! Just copy the URL.
- Some performance improvements.

Have fun!
