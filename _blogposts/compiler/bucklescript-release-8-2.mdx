## New Release

We are happy to announce BuckleScript 8.2, which comes a great feature: string literal types. 

This is so exciting that we write a [dedicated post](https://reasonml.org/blog/string-literal-types-in-reason) about it.

Besides the excited string literal types, this release continues delivering better performance of compiling, 
some internal data structures underlying the compiler are tweaked to save around 40% memory.

Thanks to the integration of Flow parser, we are able to make the JS interop [more safe and expressive](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/issues/4463)


The full changes are listed [here](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/blob/master/Changes.md)

Enjoy!
