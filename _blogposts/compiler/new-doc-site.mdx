Surprise! We've unified our documentation process with
[ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/)'s. The docs revamp
addresses one of the biggest demands for BuckleScript.

**A few highlights:**

- The old doc site still exists at the [same
  location](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html), to
  preserve backward-compat for docs for a while.
- Internationalization is now here and works the same way as ReasonReact's. Go
  wild.
- The sections are now more cleanly organized.
- More docs, simpler sections, more examples, fewer typos, nicer styling.
- Reason code snippets alongside the OCaml snippets!

Enjoy and have a nice weekend!
