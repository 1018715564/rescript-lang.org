## New Changes

Besides a number of minor bug fixes and perf improvement, most notable changes

- Bundled Reason together thanks to Reason team, so that Reason syntax support
  is also first class, this also makes Reason for the first time available to
  Windows users.
- FFI added
  [`bs.uncurry`](/docs/reason-compiler/latest/function#curry--uncurry)
  which will automatically uncurry the callback so the user land API is clearer
- Improve [object label
  translation](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_object_label_translation_convention)
  to cause less surprise, this might case minor backward compatibility
