# A better Documentation Platform for Reason & BuckleScript

The website `reasonml.org` is dedicated to a better doc experience for the
Reason & BuckleScript platform and is currently a **Work in Progress**.
Project announcements and current roadmap are documented
[here](https://www.reason-association.org/projects/better-learning-materials-and-tools). 

**Current Focus:** Belt API documentation

## How to contribute

We are currently in the process of extracting Belt documentation from the
BuckleScript source code. Each module (e.g. `Belt.List`) will have its own
dedicated markdown file.

**Possiblilties for contributions:**

- Extract documentation from the original source code w/ convertion to Reason syntax
- Improvement of usage examples
- Working on mechanics to automatically verify & test the examples inside the markdown for CI

The project is still in an early stage, so we don't have any contribution
guidelines yet. As a start, refer to existing modules and ask questions on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml) or ping [@ryyppy](https://twitter.com/ryyppy).
