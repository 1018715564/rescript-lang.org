# ReScript (previous known as BuckleScript & Reason)

This is the one and only official documentation site for the ReScript language, which replaces the old [bucklescript.github.io](//bucklescript.github.io) site and parts of [reasonml.github.io](//reasonml.github.io).

<Warn>

The `rescript-lang.org` website is currently not ready yet and will be heavily
restructured in the near future. Don't rely on the URL structure etc.

We will introduce permalinks with our first stable release.

</Warn>

## Why the rebrand?

We strongly believe that the ReScript compiler and syntax will provide the best
experience to write JS and React applications. Unifiying the tools in one coherent
platform and core team allows us to build features that wouldn't be possible in
the original BuckleScript + ReasonML setup.

This has no impact on the development of the ReasonML language. In contrary, ReasonML
can now focus on their goals, as much as we can focus on ours.

## What Will Change with ReScript?

Technically, not much. One of our main goals is to keep backwards compatibility
for existing BuckleScript codebases and will provide an automated upgrade path
from `.re` (Reason) to `.res` (ReScript) files.

The BuckleScript compiler toolchain and its new `.res` syntax will be unified
into one platform called ReScript. Upgrading from the bs-platform to the
soon-to-be-published ReScript npm package will just be a matter of updating
your package.json file. Syntax wise, we believe that previous Reason users will
feel right at home.

ReScript will continue shipping the old Reason v3.6 syntax as well and it will
be possible to mix `.re` and `.res` files in one codebase (same with
libraries).

More details about future compatibility with Reason can be found in
one of our [future commitment blog
post](https://reasonml.org/blog/a-note-on-bucklescripts-future-commitments).
