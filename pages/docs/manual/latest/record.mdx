# Record

Records are like JavaScript objects but:

- are immutable by default
- have fixed fields (not extensible)

## Type Declaration

A record needs a mandatory type declaration:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res prelude
type person = {
  age: int,
  name: string,
}
```
```js
// Empty output
```

</CodeTab>

The value of the record fields can be declared as `option`, just like you'd expect. In addition, the presence of the record fields themselves can also be specified as optional, by putting a `?` after the field name:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res prelude
type person = {
  age: int,
  name?: string
}
```
```js
// Empty output
```

</CodeTab>

This has 2 effects, both of which we'll dive deeper into later:
1. You don't need to specify the field when creating the record
2. Its type is automatically option, and the value defaults to `None` when the field is not specified

The resulting type of the `name` field above will therefore be `option<string>`.

## Creation

To create a `person` record (declared above):

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res prelude
let me = {
  age: 5,
  name: "Big ReScript"
}
```
```js
var me = {
  age: 5,
  name: "Big ReScript"
};
```

</CodeTab>

When you create a new record value, ReScript tries to find a record type declaration that conforms to the shape of the value. So the `me` value here is inferred as of type `person`.

The type is found by looking above the `me` value. **Note**: if the type instead resides in another file or module, you need to explicitly indicate which file or module it is:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
// School.res
type person = {age: int, name: string}
```
```js
// Empty output
```

</CodeTab>

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
// Example.res

let me: School.person = {age: 20, name: "Big ReScript"}
/* or */
let me2 = {School.age: 20, name: "Big ReScript"}
```
```js
var me = {
  age: 20,
  name: "Big ReScript"
};
var me2 = {
  age: 20,
  name: "Big ReScript"
};
```

</CodeTab>

Either of the above 3 says "this record's definition is found in the School file". The first one, the regular type annotation, is preferred.

### Optional Fields
For records with optional fields, just set the fields you're interested in:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res prelude
type person = {
  age: int,
  name?: string
}

let me = {
  age: 5,
  name: "Big ReScript"
}

let friend = {
  age: 7
}
```
```js
var me = {
  age: 5,
  name: "Big ReScript"
};

var friend = {
  age: 7
};
```

</CodeTab>

Notice how the fields not set will also not end up in the JavaScript output.

## Access

Use the familiar dot notation:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let name = me.name
```
```js
var name = "Big ReScript";
```

</CodeTab>

## Immutable Update

New records can be created from old records with the `...` spread operator. The original record isn't mutated.

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let meNextYear = {...me, age: me.age + 1}
```
```js
var meNextYear = {
  age: 21,
  name: "Big ReScript"
};
```

</CodeTab>

**Note**: spread cannot add new fields to the record value, as a record's shape is fixed by its type.

### Optional Fields
Updating an optional field in the scenario above works just like any other field provided you want to set a new value. However, if you want to _remove_ the value of that field, you'll need to use a special syntax. Note that to remove a field here means to set its value to `None`. It looks like this:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
type person = {
  age: int,
  name?: string
}

let me = {
  age: 123,
  name: "Hello"
}

let withoutName = {
  ...me,
  name: ?None
}
```
```js
import * as Caml_obj from "./stdlib/caml_obj.js";

var me = {
  age: 123,
  name: "Hello"
};

var newrecord = Caml_obj.obj_dup(me);

newrecord.name = undefined;

var withoutName = newrecord;
```

</CodeTab>

## Mutable Update

Record fields can optionally be mutable. This allows you to efficiently update those fields in-place with the `=` operator.

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
type person = {
  name: string,
  mutable age: int
}

let baby = {name: "Baby ReScript", age: 5}
baby.age = baby.age + 1 // `baby.age` is now 6. Happy birthday!
```
```js
var baby = {
  name: "Baby ReScript",
  age: 5
};

baby.age = baby.age + 1 | 0;
```

</CodeTab>

Fields not marked with `mutable` in the type declaration cannot be mutated.

## JavaScript Output

ReScript records compile to straightforward JavaScript objects; see the various JS output tabs above.

## Tips & Tricks

### Record Types Are Found By Field Name
With records, you **cannot** say "I'd like this function to take any record type, as long as they have the field `age`". The following **won't work as intended**:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
type person = {age: int, name: string}
type monster = {age: int, hasTentacles: bool}

let getAge = (entity) => entity.age
```
```js
function getAge(entity) {
  return entity.age;
}
```

</CodeTab>

Instead, `getAge` will infer that the parameter `entity` must be of type `monster`, the closest record type with the field `age`. The following code's last line fails:

```res
let kraken = {age: 9999, hasTentacles: true}
let me = {age: 5, name: "Baby ReScript"}

getAge(kraken)
getAge(me) // type error!
```

The type system will complain that `me` is a `person`, and that `getAge` only works on `monster`. If you need such capability, use ReScript objects, described [here](object.md).

### Optional Fields in Records Can Be Useful for Bindings
Many JavaScript APIs tend to have large configuration objects that can be a bit annoying to model as records, since you previously always needed to specify all record fields when creating a record. 

Optional record fields, introduced in [`v10`](/blog/release-10-0-0#experimental-optional-record-fields), is intended to help with this. Optional fields will let you avoid having to specify all fields, and let you just specify the one's you care about. A significant improvement in ergonomics for bindings and other APIs with for example large configuration objects.

### Pattern Matching on Optional Fields
[Pattern matching](pattern-matching-destructuring), one of ReScript's most important features, has two caveats when you deal with optional fields.

When matching on the field directly, the value of the field is always treated as `option`. Example:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
type person = {
  age: int,
  name?: string,
}

let me = {
  age: 123,
  name: "Hello",
}

let isRescript = switch me.name {
| Some("ReScript") => true
| Some(_) | None => false
}
```
```js
var isRescript;

isRescript = "Hello" === "ReScript" ? true : false;

var me = {
  age: 123,
  name: "Hello"
};
```

</CodeTab>

But, when matching on the field as part of the general record structure, it's treated as the underlying, non-optional value:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
type person = {
  age: int,
  name?: string,
}

let me = {
  age: 123,
  name: "Hello",
}

let isRescript = switch me {
| {name: "ReScript"} => true
| _ => false
}

```
```js
var isRescript;

isRescript = "Hello" === "ReScript" ? true : false;

var me = {
  age: 123,
  name: "Hello"
};
```

</CodeTab>

Sometimes you _do_ want to know whether the field was set or not. You can tell the pattern matching engine about that by prefixing your option match with `?`, like this:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
type person = {
  age: int,
  name?: string,
}

let me = {
  age: 123,
  name: "Hello",
}

let nameWasSet = switch me {
| {name: ?None} => false
| {name: ?Some(_)} => true
}
```
```js
var nameWasSet = false;

var me = {
  age: 123,
  name: "Hello"
};
```

</CodeTab>

## Design Decisions

After reading the constraints in the previous sections, and if you're coming from a dynamic language background, you might be wondering why one would bother with record in the first place instead of straight using object, since the former needs explicit typing and doesn't allow different records with the same field name to be passed to the same function, etc.

1. The truth is that most of the times in your app, your data's shape is actually fixed, and if it's not, it can potentially be better represented as a combination of variant (introduced next) + record instead.
2. Since a record type is resolved through finding that single explicit type declaration (we call this "nominal typing"), the type error messages end up better than the counterpart ("structural typing", like for tuples). This makes refactoring easier; changing a record type's fields naturally allows the compiler to know that it's still the same record, just misused in some places. Otherwise, under structural typing, it might get hard to tell whether the definition site or the usage site is wrong.
