# Installation

Prerequisite: NPM, which comes with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) also works.

To install ReScript globally:

```sh
npm install -g bs-platform
```

## New Project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-project-template
cd rescript-project-template
npm install
npm run build
node src/Demo.bs.js
```

<!-- TODO: rescript template -->

That compiles your ReScript into JavaScript, then uses NodeJS to run said JavaScript. **We recommend you use our highly unique workflow of keeping a tab open for the generated `.bs.js` file**, so that you can learn how ReScript transforms to JavaScript. Not many languages output clean JavaScript code you can manually inspect!

During development, instead of running `npm run build` each time to compile, use `npm run start` to start a watcher that recompiles automatically after file changes.

Alternatively, **to start a [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/en/) app**, follow the instructions [here](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/installation).

## Integrate Into Existing JS Project

You can install ReScript locally into an existing JS project using the following steps.

### Install ReScript

```sh
npm install --save-dev bs-platform
```

### Create config file

Create a `bsconfig.json` file in the root of your project with the following content.

```json
{
  "name": "your-project-name",
  "reason": { "react-jsx": 3 },
  "bsc-flags": ["-bs-super-errors"],
  "sources": [
    {
      "dir": "src",
      "subdirs": true
    }
  ],
  "package-specs": [
    {
      "module": "es6",
      "in-source": true
    }
  ],
  "suffix": ".bs.js",
  "namespace": true,
  "bs-dependencies": [],
  "ppx-flags": [],
  "refmt": 3
}
```

> Update `sources` to indicate where your ReScript source files will be located.

See [Build Configuration](build-configuration) for more details on `bsconfig.json`.

### Add scripts to package.json

You may also like to add two scripts to your `package.json` to help with compiling ReScript.

```json
"scripts": {
  "re:build": "bsb -make-world -clean-world",
  "re:watch": "bsb -make-world -clean-world -w"
}
```

### Using the compiled code

Since we compile to clean readable JS files the rest of your existing toolchain (e.g. Babel and Webpack) should just work.

See the [Export to JS guide](import-from-export-to-js#export-to-javascript) to learn how to import ReScript compiled modules into your existing project.

See the [Converting from JS guide](converting-from-js) to learn how to convert existing JS code to ReScript.
