# Migrate from BuckleScript/Reason

ReScript is a rebranding and cleanup of BuckleScript & Reason that enables us to ship a tighter compile-to-JS stack with more coherent documentation & tools. If you're an existing user of BuckleScript & Reason, here's the gist:

- ReScript is mostly just BuckleScript rebranded, with a new syntax that's like the Reason syntax, but catered more toward the JavaScript crowd.
- All your existing code will keep working even if you don't upgrade.

## Upgrade Your Codebase

There are lots of exciting improvements in the new syntax (features, speed, error messages, etc.). The upgrade is trivial and backward-compatible:

- Upgrade your project to `bs-platform 8.2.0`.
- `node_modules/.bin/bsc -format MyFile.re > MyFile.res`

**That's it**! You can convert over your files one by one. `MyFile.re` could be any `.re`, `.rei`, `.ml` and `.mli` file.

Enjoy the improved experience!
