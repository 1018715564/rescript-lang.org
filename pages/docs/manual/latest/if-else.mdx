# If-Else

Unlike its JavaScript counterpart, ReScript's `if` is an expression; they evaluate to their body's content:

```res
let message = if isMorning {
  "Good morning!"
} else {
  "Hello!"
}
```

**Note:** an `if-else` expression without the final `else` branch implicitly gives `()`. So this:

```res
if showMenu {
  displayMenu()
}
```

is basically the same as:

```res
if showMenu {
  displayMenu()
} else {
  ()
}
```

Which is usually what you'd expect; `displayMenu()` should return unit too.

Here's another way to look at it. This is clearly wrong:

```res
let result = if showMenu {
  1 + 2
}
```

It'll give a type error, saying basically that the implicit `else` branch has the type `unit` while the `if` branch has type `int`. Intuitively, this makes sense: what would `result`'s value be, if `showMenu` was `false`?

We also have ternary sugar.

```res
let message = isMorning ? "Good morning!" : "Hello!"
```

## Usage

**`if-else` and ternary are much less used** in ReScript than in other languages; [Pattern-matching](pattern-matching) kills a whole category of code that previously required conditionals. Prefer `if-else` if you only have, say, 2 branches.

## Design Decisions

ReScript ternary is just a sugar for the `bool` variant and a switch:

```res
switch isMorning {
| true => "Good morning!"
| false => "Hello!"
}
```

If you pass that through our formatter, you'd get:

```res
isMorning ? "Good morning!" : "Hello!"
```
