# Mutation

ReScript has great traditional imperative & mutative programming capabilities. You should use these features sparingly, but sometimes they allow your code to be more performant and written in a more familiar pattern.

## Mutate Let-binding

Let-bindings are immutable, but you can wrap it with a `ref`, exposed as a record with a single mutable field in the standard library:

```res
let foo = ref(5)
```

## Usage

You can get the actual value of a `ref` box through accessing its `contents` field:

```res
let five = foo.contents // 5
```

Assign a new value to `foo` like so:

```res
foo.contents = 6
```

We provide a syntax sugar for this:

```res
foo := 6
```

Note that the previous binding `five` stays `5`, since it got the underlying item on the `ref` box, not the `ref` itself.

## Tip & Tricks

Before reaching for `ref`, know that you can achieve lightweight, local "mutations" through overriding let bindings:

```res
let foo = 10
let foo = someCondition ? foo + 5 : foo
Js.log(foo) /* either 15 or 10 */
```
