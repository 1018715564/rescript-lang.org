# Boolean

A boolean has the type `bool` and can be either `true` or `false`. Common operations:

- `&&`: logical and.
- `||`: logical or.
- `!`: logical not.
- `<=`, `>=`, `<`, `>`
- `==`: structural equal, compares data structures deeply: `(1, 2) == (1, 2)` is `true`. Convenient, but use with caution.
- `===`: referential equal, compares shallowly. `(1, 2) === (1, 2)` is `false`. `let myTuple = (1, 2); myTuple === myTuple` is `true`.
- `!=`: structural unequal.
- `!==`: referential unequal.

ReScript's `true/false` compiles into a JavaScript `true/false`.
