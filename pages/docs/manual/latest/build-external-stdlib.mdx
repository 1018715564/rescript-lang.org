# External Stdlib

**Since 9.0**

In a typical ReScript application, you'd ship a package with an npm dependency to `bs-platform` (`rescript`), which means downloading several tens of megabytes of executables.

Whenever you'd want to publish a package just for pure JS consumption / lean container deployment (package MB sizes), you'd be required to use a bundler to bundle up all the required stdlib runtime modules with your package source, which is not ideal. 

To fix this problem, you can configure your ReScript project to use our external stdlib package ([`@rescript/std`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rescript/std)) and make `bs-platform` a dev-only dependency.

Every ReScript package release has a matching `@rescript/std` release for runtime compatibility.

**Important:** To prevent unnecessary complications, only use this feature when...
- You want to ship a library for JS / TS consumers without making them depend on `bs-platform`
- You can't depend on `bs-platform` due to toolchain size (docker containers, low-storage deployment devices, etc)

## Configuration

For example, let's assume we want to build a JS-only package that is built with ReScript 9.0. First, we would set up our dependencies like this:

```
npm install bs-platform@9.0.0 --save-dev
npm install @rescript/std@9.0.0 --save
```

In our `bsconfig.json`, we set up the following configuration:

```json
{
  /* ... */
  "external-stdlib" : "@rescript/std"
}
```

Now our compiled JS code will point to the defined external-stdlib path (check the JS output of the following code snippet):

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JavaScript"]}>

```res
Belt.Array.forEach([1, 2, 3], (num) => Js.log(num))
```

```js
// Note the import path starting with "@rescript/std".
import * as Belt_Array from "@rescript/std/lib/es6/belt_Array.js";

Belt_Array.forEach([
      1,
      2,
      3
    ], (function (num) {
        console.log(num);
        
      }));
```

</CodeTab>

**Important:** When using the `external-stdlib` configuration, always make sure the version numbers of `bs-platform` and `@rescript/std` match in your `package.json` file. Otherwise you might run into runtime problems due to mismatching stdlib behavior.
