# External Stdlib

**Since 9.0**

In a typical ReScript application, you'd ship a package with an npm dependency to `bs-platform` (`rescript`), which means downloading several tens of megabytes of executables.

Whenever a ReScript developer wants to publish a package just for pure JS consumption / lean container deployment, they would be required to use a bundler to bundle up their library / stdlib code, which is not ideal. 

To fix this problem, you can just depend on our pre-compiled stdlib JS files, published as a separate npm package called [`@rescript/std`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rescript/std). Each new ReScript release has a matching `@rescript/std` release for runtime compatibility.

## Configuration

For example, let's assume we want to build a JS package that is built on ReScript 9.0. We'd first install our `@rescript/std` package:

```
npm install bs-platform@9.0.0 --save-dev
npm install @rescript/std@9.0.0 --save
```

In your `bsconfig.json`, set up following configuration:

```json
{
  /* ... */
  "external-stdlib" : "@rescript/std"
}
```

With this configuration set, compiled JS code will now point to the defined external-stdlib path:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JavaScript"]}>

```res
Belt.Array.forEach([1, 2, 3], (num) => Js.log(num))
```

```js
// Note the import path starting with "@rescript/std"
import * as Belt_Array from "@rescript/std/lib/es6/belt_Array.js";

Belt_Array.forEach([
      1,
      2,
      3
    ], (function (num) {
        console.log(num);
        
      }));
```

</CodeTab>

The JavaScript output above was compiled with an `es6` target, but will also work with `commonjs`.

**Important:** When using this option, you need to make sure that the version number of `bs-platform` and `@rescript/std` matches with the same version number in your `package.json` file, otherwise you'll eventually run into runtime problems due to mismatching stdlib behavior!

To prevent unnecessary complications, only use this feature when...
- You want to ship a library for JS / TS consumers without making them depend on `bs-platform`
- You can't depend on `bs-platform` due to toolchain size (docker containers, low-storage deployment devices, etc)
