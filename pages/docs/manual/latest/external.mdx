# External

`external`, or "FFI" (foreign function interface), or simply "interop" (for "interoperability") is how ReScript brings in existing JavaScript values.

Imagine writing a let binding, but with its body omitted and its (mandatory) type written down:

```res
@bs.val external getElementsByClassName:
  string => array<Dom.element> = "document.getElementsByClassName"
```

**Note**: `external`s can only be at the top level, or inside a module definition. You can't declare them in e.g. a function body.

## Usage

You'd use an external value/function as if it was a normal let binding.

## Tips & Tricks

If you come from a JavaScript background: **do take some time to learn about the [externals](/docs/reason-compiler/latest/intro-to-external)**! In the beginning, you'll likely encounter quite a few `external`s before you get to write 100% pure idiomatic ReScript code.

## Design Decisions

ReScript takes interoperating with existing code very seriously. Our type system has very strong guarantees. However, such strong feature also means that, without a great interop system, it'd be very hard to gradually convert a codebase over to ReScript. Fortunately, the FFI allows us to cooperate very well with [dirty, existing code](converting-from-js). The combination of a sound type system + great interop means that we get the benefits of a traditional gradual type system regarding incremental codebase coverage & conversion, without the downside of such gradual type system: complex features to support existing patterns, slow analysis, diminishing return in terms of type coverage, etc.
