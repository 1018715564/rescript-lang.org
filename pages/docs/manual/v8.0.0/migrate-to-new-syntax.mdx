# Migrate to New Syntax

Starting from `v8.2.0`, BuckleScript and the JS part of Reason are now fused into the new ReScript. We've also introduced a new syntax similar to the old Reason syntax, but [tremendously improved](https://reasonml.org/blog/bucklescript-8-1-new-syntax).

The old ML and Reason syntax are still supported (see our support commitment [here](https://reasonml.org/blog/a-note-on-bucklescripts-future-commitments)). The gist is: this is mostly just a rebranding and shouldn't affect your existing code much.

## Upgrade Your Codebase

There are lots of exciting improvements in the new syntax (features, speed, error messages, etc.). The upgrade is trivial, backward-compatible and can be done on a per-file basis:

- Upgrade your project to `bs-platform 8.2.0`.
- `node_modules/.bin/bsc -format MyFile.re > MyFile.res`

**That's it**! `MyFile.re` could be any `.re`, `.rei`, `.ml` and `.mli` file.

Enjoy the improved experience!
