# External

`external`, or "FFI" (foreign function interface), or simply "interop" (for "interoperability") is how ReScript brings in and use JavaScript values.

Imagine writing a let binding, but

`external` is like a let binding, but:
- You need to prepend the `external` with one of the `@bs` annotations.
- The right side isn't a value; it's the name of the JS value you're binding to.
- The type for the binding is mandatory, since we need to know what the type of that JS value is.

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```re
@bs.val external getElementsByClassName:
  string => array<Dom.element>
  = "document.getElementsByClassName"
```
```js
// Empty output
```

</CodeTab>

**Note**: `external`s can only be at the top level, or inside a module definition. You can't declare them in e.g. a function body.

Once declared, you can use an `external` as a normal value, just like a let binding.

`external`s declarations are inlined into their callers during compilation, **and completely disappear from the JS output**. No performance cost!

## Usage

You'd use an external value/function as if it was a normal let binding.

## Tips & Tricks

If you come from a JavaScript background: **do take some time to learn about the externals**! You'll likely encounter quite a few `external`s before you get to write 100% pure idiomatic ReScript code.

## Design Decisions

ReScript takes interoperating with existing code very seriously. Our type system has very strong guarantees. However, such strong feature also means that, without a great interop system, it'd be very hard to gradually convert a codebase over to ReScript. Fortunately, the FFI allows us to cooperate very well with [dirty, existing code](converting-from-js). The combination of a sound type system + great interop means that we get the benefits of a traditional gradual type system regarding incremental codebase coverage & conversion, without the downside of such gradual type system: complex features to support existing patterns, slow analysis, diminishing return in terms of type coverage, etc.
