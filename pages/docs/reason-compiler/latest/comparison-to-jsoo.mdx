# Comparison to Js_of_ocaml

Js_of_ocaml is a popular compiler which compiles OCamlâ€™s bytecode into JavaScript. It is the inspiration for this project, and has already been under development for several years and is ready for production. ReScript's motivation, like js_of_ocaml, is to unify the ubiquity of the JavaScript platform and the truly sophisticated type system of OCaml.

However, there are a few areas that ReScript approaches differently:

- Js_of_ocaml takes low-level bytecode from OCaml compiler, ReScript takes the high-level rawlambda representation from OCaml compiler.
- Js_of_ocaml focuses more on existing OCaml ecosystem (OPAM) while ReScript's major goal is to target NPM/Yarn and existing JS workflows.
- Js_of_ocaml and ReScript have slightly different runtime encoding in several places. For example, ReScript encodes OCaml Array as JS Array while js_of_ocaml requires its index 0 to be of value 0.
