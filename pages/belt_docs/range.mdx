title: Range

A small module to provide a inclusive range operations `[start, finsish]`, it use a for-loop internally instead of creating an array

## forEachU

```
let forEachU: (int, int, [@bs] (int => unit)) => unit;
```

## forEach

```
let forEach: (int, int, int => unit) => unit;
```

`forEach(start, finish, action);`

equivalent to `Belt.Array.(forEach(range(start, finish), action));`

## everyU

```
let everyU: (int, int, [@bs] (int => bool)) => bool;
```

## every

```
let every: (int, int, int => bool) => bool;
```

`every(start, finish, p);`

equivalent to `Belt.Array.(every(range(start, finish), p));`

## everyByU

```
let everyByU: (int, int, ~step: int, [@bs] (int => bool)) => bool;
```

## everyBy

```
let everyBy: (int, int, ~step: int, int => bool) => bool;
```

`everyBy(start, finish, ~step, p);`

See `Belt_Array.rangeBy`

equivalent to `Belt.Array.(every(rangeBy(start, finish, ~step), p));`

## someU

```
let someU: (int, int, [@bs] (int => bool)) => bool;
```

## some

```
let some: (int, int, int => bool) => bool;
```

`some(start, finish, p);`

equivalent to `Belt.Array.(some(range(start, finish), p));`

## someByU

```
let someByU: (int, int, ~step: int, [@bs] (int => bool)) => bool;
```

## someBy

```
let someBy: (int, int, ~step: int, int => bool) => bool;
```

`someBy(start, finish, ~step, p);`

See `Belt_Array.rangeBy`

equivalent to `Belt.Array.(some(rangeBy(start, finish, ~step), p));`
