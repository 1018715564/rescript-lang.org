# Id

<ApiIntro>

Provide utilities to create identified comparators or hashes for data
structures used below.

It create a unique identifier per module of functions so that different data
structures with slightly different comparison functions won't mix.

</ApiIntro>

## hash

```
type hash('a, 'id);
```

Its runtime represenation is a hash function, but signed with a type parameter, so that different hash functions type mismatch.

## eq

```
type eq('a, 'id);
```

Its runtime represenation is an eq function, but signed with a type parameter, so that different hash functions type mismatch.

## cmp

```
type cmp('a, 'id);
```

Its runtime representation is a cmp function, but signed with a type parameter, so that different hash functions type mismatch.

## Comparable

```
module type Comparable {
  type identity;

  type t;

  let cmp: BeltId.cmp(t, identity);
}
```

## comparable

```
type ('key,'id) comparable = (module BeltId.Comparable with type identity = 'id and type t = 'key)
```

is a module of functions, here it only includes cmp.

Unlike normal functions, when created, it comes with a unique identity (guaranteed by the type system).

It can be created using function `Belt_Id.comparableU` or `Belt_Id.comparable`.

The idea of a unique identity when created is that it makes sure two sets would type mismatch if they use different comparison function

## MakeComparableU

```
module MakeComparableU: (M: {type t; let cmp: [@bs] ((t, t) => int);}) => Comparable with type t = M.t;
```

## MakeComparable

```
module MakeComparable: (M: {type t; let cmp: (t, t) => int;}) => Comparable with type t = M.t;
```

## comparableU

```
let comparableU: (~cmp: [@bs] (('a, 'a) => int)) => (module BeltId.Comparable with type t = 'a);
```

## comparable

```
type ('key, 'id) comparable = (module BeltId.Comparable with type identity = 'id and type t = 'key)
```

## Hashable

```
module type Hashable = {
  type identity;

  type t;

  let hash: BeltId.hash(t, identity);

  let eq: BeltId.eq(t, identity);
}
```

## hashable

```
type hashable('key, 'id) = (module BeltId.Hashable with type identity = 'id and type t = 'key);
```

is a module of functions, here it only includes hash, eq.

Unlike normal functions, when created, it comes with a unique identity (guaranteed by the type system).

It can be created using function `Belt_Id.hashableU` or `Belt_Id.hashable`.

The idea of a unique identity when created is that it makes sure two hash sets would type mismatch if they use different comparison function.

## MakeHashableU

```
module MakeHashableU: (M: {type t; let hash: [@bs] (t => int); let eq: [@bs] ((t, t) => bool);}) => Hashable with type t = M.t;
```

## MakeHashable

```
module MakeHashable: (M: {type t; let hash: t => int; let eq: (t, t) => bool;}) => Hashable with type t = M.t;
```

## hashableU

```
let hashableU: (~hash: [@bs] ('a => int), ~eq: [@bs] (('a, 'a) => bool)) => (module BeltId.Hashable with type t = 'a);
```

## hashable

```
let hashable: (~hash: 'a => int, ~eq: ('a, 'a) => bool) => (module BeltId.Hashable with type t = 'a);
```
