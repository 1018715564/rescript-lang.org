The `@meth` decorator is used to call a function on a JavaScript object, and avoid issues with currying.

For example, consider the following JavaScript code:

```js
function say (a, b) {
  console.log(a, b);
};

var john = { 
  say
};
```

The shape of the john object could be typed and accessed as follows:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
type person = {@meth "say": (string, string) => unit}

@val external john: person = "john"

john["say"]("hey", "jude")
```

```js
john.say("hey", "jude");
```

</CodeTab>

Note that we are using the object property notation to access the method.

If you omit the `@meth` decorator in the function signature, the type checker will error, because it is ensured by the compiler to enforce only fully applied functions in JavaScript objects.
