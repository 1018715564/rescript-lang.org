The `@as` decorator may be used on record types to alias record names to a different JavaScript attribute name.

This is mostly useful to map to JavaScript attribute names that cannot be expressed in ReScript (such as keywords).

For example

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```re
type action = {
  @as("type") type_: string
}

let action = {type_: "ADD_USER"}
```

```js
var action = {
  type: "ADD_USER"
};
```

</CodeTab>
