The `@as` decorator may be used on record types to alias record field names to a different JavaScript attribute name.

This is mostly useful to map to JavaScript attribute names that cannot be expressed in ReScript (such as keywords).

For example:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```re
type action = {
  @as("type") type_: string
}

let action = {type_: "ADD_USER"}
```

```js
var action = {
  type: "ADD_USER"
};
```

</CodeTab>

It may also be used when declaring external [polymorphic variants](/docs/manual/latest/polymorphic-variant). See the `@string` and `@int` decorators for more details.
