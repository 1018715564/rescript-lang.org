The `@unboxed` decorator provides a way to unwrap **variant** constructors that have a *single* argument, or **record** objects that have a *single* field.

For example, consider the following code:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```re
type name = Name(string)
let studentName = Name("Joe")

type greeting = {message: string}
let hi = {message: "hello!"}
```

```js
var studentName = /* Name */{
  _0: "Joe"
};

var hi = {
  message: "hello!"
};
```

</CodeTab>

When compiled to JavaScript, these values are represented as objects.

If we now add the `@unboxed` decorator, the object wrappers are removed from the JavaScript output:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```re
@unboxed
type name = Name(string)
let studentName = Name("Joe")

@unboxed
type greeting = {message: string}
let hi = {message: "hello!"}
```

```js
var studentName = "Joe";
var hi = "hello!";
```

</CodeTab>
