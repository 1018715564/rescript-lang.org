summary: "This is the `@new` decorator."
category: "decorators"

The `@new` decorator is used whenever you need to bind to a JavaScript class constructor that requires the `new` keword for instantiation.

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```re
type t

@new external create: unit => t = "Date"

let now = create()
```

```js
var now = new Date();
```

</CodeTab>

When the object is not available on the global scope, combine it with `@module`:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```re
type t

@module @new external book: unit => t = "Book"

let myBook = book()
```

```js
var Book = require("Book");
var myBook = new Book();
```

</CodeTab>
